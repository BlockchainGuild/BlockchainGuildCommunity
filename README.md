# Blockchain Guild Community

The purpose of the [Blockchain Guild](https://github.com/BlockchainGuild) is (TBD):

Some possible thoughts:
* Apprentice, Journeyman, Master?
* Transparency to all stakeholders (patrons, customers, guild members)
* Participatory and inclusive practices
* Learning Community
* "Rough consensus & working code"
* Non-Heirarchical and Decentralized as possible
* Support infrastructure & [commons](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html) for blockchains
* To avoid needing incorporating, can we avoid custody of funds from patrons, and use multisig with timelock act as a non-custodial escrow?

## Learning Resources

* [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) — The best way to learn to learn deeply about bitcoin is to avoid GUIs (even bitcoin-qt), and instead learn it from the command line.

## Current Bounties

* 0.5 BTC, split among Apprentice contributions to testing confirming the quality of [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) tutorial and helping update it to Bitcoin 0.15.1
* 0.5 BTC, for an accepted Journeymam proposal and final code for a simple C app doing RPC to bitcoind using some [libwally-core](https://github.com/ElementsProject/libwally-core) to Chapter 12 of [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line).
* 0.5 BTC, for an accepted Journeyman proposal and final code for a better C-based RPC library to bitcoind than used in Chapter 12 of [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line).

## RoadMap

- [x] Create Github Community

- [ ] Create website for blockchainguild.com, maybe also blockchaincommons.org (ChristopherA currently holds these domains)

- [ ] We need a CONTRIBUTING.md, something along the lines of [ParticipatoryOrgs-Community/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) & [ipfs/contributing.md](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/contributing.md)

- [ ] Convene an online community meeting of initial participants, create an initial proposal for participatory governance
