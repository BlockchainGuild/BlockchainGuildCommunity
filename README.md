## Learning Resources

* [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) — The best way to learn to learn deeply about bitcoin is to avoid GUIs (even bitcoin-qt), and instead learn it from the command line.

## Current Bounties

* 0.5 BTC, split among Apprentice contributions to testing confirming the quality of [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) tutorial and helping update it to Bitcoin 0.15.1
* 0.5 BTC, for an accepted Journeymam proposal and final code for a simple C app doing RPC to bitcoind using some [libwally-core](https://github.com/ElementsProject/libwally-core) to Chapter 12 of [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line).
* 0.5 BTC, for an accepted Journeyman proposal and final code for a better C-based RPC library to bitcoind than used in Chapter 12 of [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line).
