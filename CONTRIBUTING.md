# How to Contribute

This is an open source project and we welcome contributions.

* Allow Patrons to be able to contribute back to support the open source ecosystem that allowed them to be successful.
* Incentivize junior software engineers or those new to blockchain develop to learn the best practices of the community, and allow more experienced engineers a place to mentor them.
* Support blockchain documentation, example code, libraries, infrastructure, etc.
